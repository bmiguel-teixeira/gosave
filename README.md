# GoSave

Generic client for cloud blob storage. It is meant to be an open-source replacement for generic cloud storage like dropbox, onedrive and such. Main focus is simple file storage and not file sharing. All remote data is encrypted at rest and ruing transit, with only the clients having the unencrypted data.

# Supported storage backends
```bash
Azure Blob Storage
```
